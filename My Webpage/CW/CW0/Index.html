Users of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them little control over the
way that a page is displayed. It should be remembered that HTML was developed as a means
of marking up the structure of a document not as a way of determining its presentation.
Formatting text to appear on a Web page is therefore different from formatting text to appear
in a printed document.
