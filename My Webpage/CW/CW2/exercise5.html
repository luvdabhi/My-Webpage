	I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me<br/>
	Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me<br/>
	Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me<br/>
	You know how I like it when you lovin' on me<br/>
	I don't wanna die for them to miss me<br/>
	Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me<br/>
	Hope I got some brothers that outlive me<br/>
	They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me<br/><br/>
